# Section 1

This is Rob's class repository for section 1 of J4502. You'll find class examples and all sorts of other stuff here, eventually.

UPDATE: I have added two files to this repo: Readings and Resources.

Readings is where you'll find the reading schedule (or occasionally watching schedule, for recommended items from Treehouse).

Resources is for links to items that I showed in class or plan to show in class.

Any questions, hit me up on Slack.
